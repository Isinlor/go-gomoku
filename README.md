# GoGomoku engine + browser AI

This package implements the ruleset you described for a browser-safe GoGomoku core:

- board sizes: 9x9, 11x11, 13x13
- five-in-a-row wins horizontally, vertically, or diagonally
- Go-style captures by removing opponent groups with no liberties
- simplified ko: immediate recapture is forbidden
- suicide is illegal **unless** the move creates five-in-a-row, which wins immediately
- iterative deepening negamax / minimax with alpha-beta pruning
- quiescence search for tactical continuations
- hard time limit with best-so-far return semantics
- 100% line / branch / function coverage enforced by the test command

## Project layout

- `src/gogomoku.ts` — rules engine, make/undo, ko, captures, legal move checks
- `src/ai.ts` — iterative deepening alpha-beta search, move ordering, quiescence
- `src/index.ts` — public exports
- `tests/*.test.js` — full coverage test suite
- `browser-demo/index.html` — minimal playable browser harness

## Build and verify

```bash
npm run build
npm run test
npm run coverage
```

The coverage command is configured with 100% thresholds for lines, branches, and functions.

## Browser usage

Build first:

```bash
npm run build
```

Then serve the project root with any static file server and open `browser-demo/index.html`.

Example using Python:

```bash
python -m http.server 8000
```

Then open `http://localhost:8000/browser-demo/`.

## Public API

```ts
import { GogoPosition, GogoAI, BLACK, WHITE } from './build/src/index.js';

const position = new GogoPosition(9);
const ai = new GogoAI({ maxDepth: 6, quiescenceDepth: 6, maxPly: 96 });

position.playXY(4, 4);          // black
const result = ai.findBestMove(position, 75);
position.play(result.move);      // white AI reply
```

### `GogoPosition`

Key methods:

- `play(index)` / `playXY(x, y)`
- `undo()`
- `isLegal(index)`
- `hasAnyLegalMove()`
- `generateAllLegalMoves(buffer)`
- `scanGroup(start, color)` with `scanGroupSize`
- `index(x, y)` and `at(x, y)`

Key fields:

- `board: Uint8Array`
- `toMove`
- `winner`
- `koPoint`
- `lastMove`
- `lastCapturedCount`

### `GogoAI`

Constructor options:

- `maxDepth` — iterative deepening cap
- `quiescenceDepth` — tactical extension depth
- `maxPly` — recursion safety cap
- `now` — injectable clock, useful for deterministic tests

Search result:

- `move`
- `score`
- `depth`
- `nodes`
- `timedOut`

## Optimization notes

The implementation stays allocation-light in the hot path:

- board state is a `Uint8Array`
- group search uses reusable typed-array stacks and buffers
- move generation uses reusable typed-array buffers per ply
- search relies on in-place `play()` / `undo()` rather than cloned positions
- candidate generation is locality-biased to keep branching down
- move ordering combines pattern scores, tactical pressure, center bias, and history

## Search design

The AI uses:

- iterative deepening
- alpha-beta negamax
- locality-based candidate generation
- tactical move ordering
- quiescence on forcing moves such as wins, blocks, captures, and escapes
- fallback move selection when the time budget expires before a full iteration completes

## Rule decisions encoded

A few ambiguities were fixed explicitly:

- simplified ko is implemented as standard immediate recapture prevention for single-stone ko
- five-in-a-row overrides suicide legality, but not ko illegality
- captures are resolved before the final suicide check
- a move that makes five wins immediately, even if the resulting group has no liberties
