# GoGomoku engine + browser AI

This package implements a browser-safe GoGomoku core with a Vue-based UI:

- board sizes: 9x9, 11x11, 13x13
- five-in-a-row wins horizontally, vertically, or diagonally
- Go-style captures by removing opponent groups with no liberties
- simplified ko: immediate recapture is forbidden
- suicide is illegal **unless** the move creates five-in-a-row, which wins immediately
- iterative deepening negamax / minimax with alpha-beta pruning
- quiescence search for tactical continuations
- hard time limit with best-so-far return semantics
- AI computations run in a Web Worker to keep the UI responsive
- 100% line / branch / function coverage enforced by the test command

## Project layout

- `src/engine/gogomoku.ts` — rules engine, make/undo, ko, captures, legal move checks
- `src/engine/ai.ts` — iterative deepening alpha-beta search, move ordering, quiescence
- `src/engine/index.ts` — public engine exports
- `src/worker/ai-worker.ts` — Web Worker for AI computations
- `src/composables/useGame.ts` — Vue composable managing game state and worker communication
- `src/components/` — Vue components (BoardGrid, GameToolbar, GameRecord, LoadGame)
- `src/App.vue` — root Vue component
- `src/main.ts` — application entry point
- `index.html` — Vite entry HTML
- `tests/` — full coverage test suite (Vitest)
- `vite.config.ts` — Vite build configuration
- `vitest.config.ts` — Vitest test configuration

## Build and verify

```bash
npm run build
npm run test
npm run coverage
```

The coverage command is configured with 100% thresholds for lines, branches, and functions.

To run locally, use Node 24 and run from the new version's checkout. The benchmark
needs no installed dependencies or test runner:

```bash
npm run test:performance -- /path/to/master-checkout
```

Run locally with Node 24 from the candidate checkout:

```bash
npm run test:strength -- /path/to/master-checkout --time-ms 25 --alpha 0.01
```

The strength test plays all 100 openings in `scripts/strength-openings.json` in
random order with colors swapped (200 games per attempt), without an iteration
deadline or early evidence stop. Only a full set of 100 pairs is accepted. Games
are draws at 100 total plies (including the opening), on repetition, or when no
legal moves remain. The pool contains 50 Black and 50 White self-play
wins; its original evaluation metadata and engine revision are retained.
The CLI defaults to 5 ms per move and alpha 0.05; `--time-ms` and `--alpha`
configure the shared move budget and gain significance. Opening searches
interleave master and candidate, alternating who goes first. Reports include
move and eval-sign agreement between engines and with the
stored 100 ms and 10 s searches, plus candidate-only, master-only, both, and
neither agreement with the 10 s move (zero is its own eval sign).
Game results report strength gains when symmetric gain evidence reaches its threshold,
with a one-sided alpha bound across at most five attempts (threshold `5 / alpha`).

## Development

```bash
npm run dev
```

Opens a Vite dev server with hot module replacement.

## Public API

```ts
import { GogoPosition, GogoAI, BLACK, WHITE } from './src/engine';

const position = new GogoPosition(9);
const ai = new GogoAI({ maxDepth: 6, quiescenceDepth: 6, maxPly: 96 });

position.playXY(4, 4);          // black
const result = ai.findBestMove(position, 75);
position.play(result.move);      // white AI reply
```

### `GogoPosition`

Key methods:

- `play(index)` / `playXY(x, y)`
- `undo()`
- `isLegal(index)`
- `hasAnyLegalMove()`
- `generateAllLegalMoves(buffer)`
- `scanGroup(start, color)` with `scanGroupSize`
- `index(x, y)` and `at(x, y)`

Key fields:

- `board: Uint8Array`
- `toMove`
- `winner`
- `koPoint`
- `lastMove`
- `lastCapturedCount`

### `GogoAI`

Constructor options:

- `maxDepth` — iterative deepening cap
- `quiescenceDepth` — tactical extension depth
- `maxPly` — recursion safety cap
- `now` — injectable clock, useful for deterministic tests

Search result:

- `move`
- `score`
- `depth`
- `nodes`
- `timedOut`

## Optimization notes

The implementation stays allocation-light in the hot path:

- board state is a `Uint8Array`
- group search uses reusable typed-array stacks and buffers
- move generation uses reusable typed-array buffers per ply
- search relies on in-place `play()` / `undo()` rather than cloned positions
- candidate generation is locality-biased to keep branching down
- move ordering combines pattern scores, tactical pressure, center bias, and history

## Search design

The AI uses:

- iterative deepening
- alpha-beta negamax
- locality-based candidate generation
- tactical move ordering
- quiescence on forcing moves such as wins, blocks, captures, and escapes
- fallback move selection when the time budget expires before a full iteration completes

## Rule decisions encoded

A few ambiguities were fixed explicitly:

- simplified ko is implemented as standard immediate recapture prevention for single-stone ko
- five-in-a-row overrides suicide legality, but not ko illegality
- captures are resolved before the final suicide check
- a move that makes five wins immediately, even if the resulting group has no liberties
